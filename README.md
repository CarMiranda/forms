Synopsis
========

This is a (web) form creator using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/ES5 + Chart.js, PHP7, MySQL and XML. It can be divided into different parts:

* Creation of the form (client and server, in development)
* Distribution of the form (server, yet to be implemented)
* Answering the form and retrieving the data (client and server, in development)
* Graphic data analysis (client and server, yet to be implemented)

Motivation
==========

This project was first intended to be used in the Association Junior de l'INSA de Rouen (AJIR) an university association in Rouen, France, as part of the Quality pole tracking tools. However, it was later decided to upload this to GitHub, thus opening the project to anyone willing to collaborate and to use the project.
